      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <p class="text-lg leading-8">
        The Clinical Research Unit at the University of Calgary has a rich history rooted
        in its origins at the Hotchkiss Brain Institute (HBI) and later becoming a key
        part of the Cumming School of Medicine. With over 18 years of experience
        supporting a plethora of study types, we have the expertise to provide data
        management guidance every step of the way.

          <h4>Origins at the Hotchkiss Brain Institute</h4>
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Founding and Purpose:</b> The Clinical Research Unit was originally established
            as part of the Hotchkiss Brain Institute (HBI) at the University of Calgary. HBI,
            founded in the early 2000's, focused on advancing neurological and mental health
            research. The CRU was designed to support clinical research by providing infrastructure,
            expertise, and services to researchers in the field of neuroscience.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Role in Neuroscience Research:</b> At HBI, the CRU played a pivotal role in
            facilitating clinical trials, observational studies, and other research initiatives
            aimed at understanding and treating neurological conditions. It provided essential
            services such as study design, data management, and regulatory support, helping
            to bridge the gap between laboratory research and clinical application.

          <h4>Transition to the Cumming School of Medicine</h4>
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Expansion and Integration:</b> As the scope of clinical research at the University
            of Calgary expanded beyond neuroscience, the CRU transitioned from being a part
            of the HBI to becoming a broader entity within the Cumming School of Medicine.
            This move reflected the growing need for clinical research support across various
            medical disciplines.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Broadened Focus:</b> Under the Cumming School of Medicine, the CRU expanded
            its services to support a wider range of medical research areas, including cardiology,
            oncology, and infectious diseases, among others. The unit continued to offer its
            expertise in clinical trial management, regulatory affairs, biostatistics, and
            research ethics, contributing to the university's overall research output.
