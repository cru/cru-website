          "It was a great pleasure and experience to have my first project build with the
          CHI REDCap team. The communication line was fantastic and I felt supported every
          step of the way. The team is highly skilled, knowledgeable and extremely
          professional.
          <br />
          They were quick to address my comments and feedback until I was completely satisfied
          with the REDCap build. Specific to my project, I was thoroughly impressed with the
          on-the-spot resolution by the CHI REDCap developer during the walkthrough of the
          project.
          <br />
          Without a doubt, I would enlist the CHI REDCap team again for their assistance on
          future studies."

            Research teams experienced in REDCap can complete the build and setup
            themselves. The CHI provides users with access to REDCap and maintains the
            REDCap platform, such as updates/patches, data backups, and system
            administration.
