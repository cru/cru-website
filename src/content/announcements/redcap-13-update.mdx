We are excited to announce the successful upgrade and validation of REDCap to version 13.7 by CRU. This instance of REDCap adheres to the requirements set by Health Canada/ICH GCP for conducting phase 3 and regulatory clinical trials.

The upgrade introduces exciting features and enhancements to elevate the user experience:

- New MyCap mobile app: Specifically designed to enhance participant engagement and retention, especially in projects with regular participant contact, such as daily or weekly surveys.
- Multi-language support: Facilitates effortless language switching in instruments, benefiting both data entry personnel and survey respondents.
- New data export options: Seamless integration with Tableau for enhanced data analysis.
- New inline preview option for uploaded images and PDF files (instead of only seeing the filename in an upload field and downloading to view it, the uploaded image/file can be displayed in RC)
- New embed option for files sent via text and email. These file/image attachments are stored in the new "Miscellaneous File Attachments" folder in the File Repository.

If you are considering starting a new REDCap project, please complete our [intake survey](https://redcap.cru.ucalgary.ca/surveys/?s=7L49EPE94D).
