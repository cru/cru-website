I am pleased to announce the Cumming School of Medicine’s (CSM) Clinical Research Unit (CRU) will merge with the [Centre for Health Informatics](https://cumming.ucalgary.ca/centres/centre-health-informatics) (CHI) on March 15, 2024. After 18 successful years as chair of the CRU, Dr. Sam Wiebe, MD, is stepping down from this role, which presents an opportunity to unify the two units.

Given the complementary services of these units, the CRU will join the CHI’s Research Services Program under the leadership of Dr. Tyler Williamson, PhD. The CRU will continue to offer high-quality services related to electronic data capture and custom software development, while the CHI will continue to support research projects with data access facilitation, methods development and health data analytics.

This exciting transition will further enhance the process for CSM researchers to access comprehensive clinical research services. Current CRU and CHI clients should experience no changes or interruption to their services.

More information on the CRU and CHI can be found at their websites or via email:

- Clinical Research Unit: chi@ucalgary.ca / [chi.ucalgary.ca](https://chi.ucalgary.ca)
- Centre for Health Informatics: chi@ucalgary.ca / [cumming.ucalgary.ca/chi](https://cumming.ucalgary.ca/chi)

<br />
<br />I would like to sincerely thank Dr. Wiebe for his dedicated service.

Sincerely,

Marcello Tonelli<br/>
Senior associate dean, Health Research<br/>
Cumming School of Medicine
