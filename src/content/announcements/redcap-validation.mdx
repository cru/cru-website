We are excited to announce that the CRU has completed the validation of its REDCap 12.4.31 instance. **This REDCap instance meets Health Canada/ICH GCP requirements to run phase 3 and regulatory clinical trials**.

This marks the start of a largescale REDCap Revitalization initiative at the CRU. We have listened to your feedback and recommendations and will be evolving our REDCap services to better meet your needs. Examples include offering newer REDCap versions with additional features, enhanced support services to help study teams learn the REDCap tool, and a more transparent fee structure for easier budgeting. We will share additional information in the coming months, including a launch-date of our Revitalized REDCap services. For additional information, please see the attached frequently asked questions.

We are happy to assist you with your electronic data capture needs. Please feel free to initiate a project request at our [service desk](https://researchcalgary.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/7) or by emailing us at cru@ucalgary.ca. We look forward to continuing our collaborations.

            The CRU has thoroughly tested our REDCap platform and developed processes to
            ensure the instance sufficiently meets these requirements.

              <li>
                Our approach to validation was to use test scripts and draft supplementary

            Note: Study teams are responsible for ensuring validation at the project level
            by testing and validating that the project setup functions as expected. The
            CRU has prepared guides to help study teams with project validation.

            REDCap is an easy-to-use EDC platform. It is widely used and many researchers
            and study teams are already familiar with it. There is a significant
            international community of REDCap users, which creates a vast support network
            for continuous improvement of our REDCap service.
          </li>
          <li>
            Other validated EDC tools (e.g., REDCap Cloud, DataFax) can be challenging to
            use and to set up databases. REDCap services are also offered at significantly
            lower cost than these other validated EDC tools.

            The CRU is developing a new pricing structure that will provide more support

            The CRU operates on a cost-recovery model. Annual maintenance fees help us
            recover overhead for maintaining the REDCap platform, such as system
            administration, backups, and supplementary license fees.
            <ul>
              <li>
                The fee for the validated instance will incorporate additional work

            The CRU is doing a phased rollout of REDCap 10. As part of REDCap

          </li>
          <li>
            Migration to REDCap 10 is mandatory. We will be decommissioning the REDCap 6
            and 7 instances.
          </li>
          <li>
            The phased approach enables us to migrate projects free of charge. Thank you
            in advance for your understanding.
          </li>
          <li>
            Projects will be emailed with migration details and timelines. Migrations are
            estimated to start in March 2022.
          </li>
          <li>
            Migration will not affect project data. Project data will remain secure and
            there is no data loss in the migration process.

            If you are starting a new CRU-supported project (i.e., the CRU is supporting

            Otherwise, new projects will start in REDCap 7 until the REDCap 10 instance is
