The Clinical Research Unit (CRU) has decommissioned REDCap versions 6 and 7 as per December 31st, 2022.

The CRU has completed the migrating of projects from the older versions of REDCap to the validated newer instance of REDCap: https://redcap.cru.ucalgary.ca. Projects will no longer be accessible. We recommend updating bookmarks to the new location.

If you had projects on REDCap 6 or 7 and your migration was not performed, please contact us if you have questions or need support. We are retaining a backup of unmigrated REDCap 6 and 7 projects up to December 2023 at which point all data will be deleted and cannot be retrieved.
