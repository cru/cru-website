Are you a UCalgary researcher with a bold vision to improve the health of Albertans? The **Ignite Grant** offers up to **$15,000** to kickstart your pilot or feasibility study â€” and if you're an early career researcher, you could get **an extra $5,000** for expert support from the Centre for Health Informatics and partners.

ðŸ’¡ Use the funding to:

- Launch clinical or observational studies
- Harness health data for prevention or treatment strategies
- Build momentum toward Tri-Council funding
