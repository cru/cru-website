We are excited to announce the successful upgrade and validation of REDCap to version 14.0.41 by CRU. This instance of REDCap adheres to the requirements set by Health Canada/ICH GCP for conducting phase 3 and regulatory clinical trials.

The upgrade introduces exciting features and enhancements to elevate the user experience:

- New feature for MyCap: Longitudinal functionality for MyCap-enabled projects. MyCap is a mobile app designed to enhance participant engagement and retention. This is especially useful for projects with regular participant contact, such as daily or weekly surveys.
- Enhanced Participant Tracking: The @MC-PARTICIPANT-CODE action tag automatically captures MyCap participant codes, simplifying project management and data collection.
- New and Rapid Retrieval Caching features: REDCap has changed its backend design, allowing speed and performance to be maintained as projects expand. Administrators can manage cache settings and storage options for optimal performance.
- Improved data import: REDCap can now handle larger import files by importing them asynchronously in the background.
- Flexible Data Management: The new "Move Project Data" page empowers administrators to seamlessly transfer project data between tables, optimizing performance with ease.
- New Project Design import/export options: the Survey Queue and Form Display Logic can now be edited using CSV files, making these features easier to modify for large projects.
- More date, math, and text functions: REDCap can now identify components from date fields (year, month, day), calculate modulo and exponentials for Euler's number (e), and perform search/replace functions in the text.
